# Funda Assignment
This project contains the assignment from [Funda.nl](https://www.funda.nl/).

## Assignment Description
Determine which makelaar's in Amsterdam have the most object listed for sale. Make a table of the top 10. 
Then do the same thing but only for objects with a tuin which are listed for sale. 
For the assignment you may write a program in any object oriented language of your choice and you may 
use any libraries that you find useful.

**Tips:**
- If you perform too many API requests in a short period of time (>100 per minute), the API will
reject the requests. Your implementation should mitigate (avoid) errors and handle any errors
that occur, so take both into account.
- Different people will look at your solution, so make sure it is easy to understand and go through.
- We don't expect solutions to have a comprehensive test suite, but we do expect solutions to be testable.

We value creative problem-solving. If you are not sure about implementation details of the exercise, please remember: 
It is more important to show your competencies than to get "the right answer". 
Please explain your decisions and thought process.
